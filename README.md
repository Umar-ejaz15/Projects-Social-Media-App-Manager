This project is a basic implementation of a social media manager, developed with the collaborative efforts of Umar Ali, Usaid Hassan, Okasha, and myself. The application allows users to create and manage their profiles, post content, comment on posts, and send messages to friends.

#### Features:
1. **User Profile Management**:
   - Users can create profiles by providing their email, username, and password.
   - Users can log in to their profiles by entering their email and password.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Secure login system that validates user credentials.
   - After multiple failed login attempts, users have the option to retry or exit the application.

3. **Social Interactions**:
   - **Friend Requests**: Users can send friend requests to other users.
   - **Posts**: Users can view posts shared by others, upload their own posts, and add comments to existing posts.
   - **Messaging**: Users can send messages to their friends through the application.

4. **File Handling**:
   - User data is stored in a file named `userData.txt` for persistent storage of user credentials.

#### Usage Flow:
1. **Profile Creation**:
   - Users are prompted to enter their email, username, and password to create an account.
   - The credentials are saved to `userData.txt`.

2. **Login**:
   - Users enter their email and password to log in.
   - If the credentials are incorrect, users are given the option to retry or exit the application.

3. **Social Features**:
   - Once logged in, users can choose to send friend requests, view and upload posts, or send messages to friends.
   - Navigation is user-friendly, with clear instructions and prompts.

This project provided a practical experience in collaborative coding, integrating file handling, user authentication, and basic social media functionalities. It also highlighted the importance of error handling and user interaction design in application development.
